# Limit of nested fields has been exceeded

If you have a lot of attributes and options, you may have the error `Limit of nested fields [100] has been exceeded`.

To change that you can [change the mapping to apply a new setting](../dist/src/Resources/config/elasticsearch/monsieurbiz_product_mapping.yaml#L11).
